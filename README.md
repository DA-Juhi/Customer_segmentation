# Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer segmentation data using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Power BI for dashboarding. The objective is to understand customer spending patterns and category preferences by analyzing age and gender, supporting targeted marketing and business decisions.

---

##  Project Goals
- Perform **EDA** to uncover customer behavior patterns.
- Analyze spending scores and purchasing frequencies across age and gender.
- Visualize category preferences for effective segmentation.
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** for interactive stakeholder insights.

---

##  Methodology

### 1️ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
- Created `age_group` by binning the `age` column.
- Filtered numeric columns for correlation analysis.

### 2️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis:**
  - Age Distribution
  - Gender Distribution
- **Bivariate Analysis:**
  - Age vs Spending Score (Box Plot)
  - Gender vs Preferred Category (Grouped Bar Plot)
  - Income vs Purchase Frequency (Scatter Plot)
  - Correlation Heatmap

### 3️ Dashboarding with Power BI
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize insights.
- Added slicers for age group, gender, and preferred categories.

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data analyst skills by combining Python-based EDA with Power BI dashboarding to communicate customer behavior insights effectively. It enables understanding of customer segments and supports targeted business strategies.
